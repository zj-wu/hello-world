# How to delete a repository

You can delete any repository or fork if you\'re either an organization owner or have admin permissions for the repository or fork. Deleting a forked repository does not delete the upstream repository.

Only members with owner privileges for an organization or admin privileges for a repository can delete an organization repository. If **Allow members to delete or transfer repositories for this organization** has been disabled, only organization owners can delete organization repositories. For more information, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)."

**Warning**: These steps will **permanently** delete the repository, wiki, issues, and comments. This action **cannot** be undone.

Please also keep in mind that:
 *  Deleting a private repository will delete all of its forks.
 *  Deleting a public repository will not delete its forks.

 1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

 2. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.

 3. Under Danger Zone, click **Delete this repository**.

 4. **Read the warnings**.
 
 5. To verify that you're deleting the correct repository, type *the name of the repository* you want to delete.
 
 6.  Click **I understand the consequences, delete this repository**.
